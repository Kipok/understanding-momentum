# Understanding the Role of Momentum in Stochastic Gradient Methods

To reproduce experiments performed in the paper, see code and comments in `experiments.ipynb`. 

To run logistic regression on MNIST or ResNet-18 on CIFAR, you can use scripts in `lr_on_mnist` and
`resnet_on_cifar` correspondingly. Run `python main.py --help` for list of available hyperparameters in both
scripts. 

To be able to run the code, you need to install the following Python packages: numpy, matplotlib, pytorch (v0.4), tensorboardx
